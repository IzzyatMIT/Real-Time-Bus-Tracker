# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
This project is an animated tracker designed to accurately populate a map with a pointer than indicates the path of travel of a bus as it moves along a route with stops at pre-determined bus stops. This code pulls in GPS map data from an outside source to populate the application and facilitate its operation.
